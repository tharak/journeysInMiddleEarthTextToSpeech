# Automatic narrator for *Journeys in Middle-earth*

***English** · [Português](README.pt-BR.md)*

Reads aloud, **entirely offline**, the text the official *The Lord of the Rings:
Journeys in Middle-earth* app (Fantasy Flight / Asmodee) puts on screen during
play. It watches the screen, works out which block of the game's text is
showing, and speaks it.

The app records narration only for each campaign's Prologue and Epilogues. Every
other block is read aloud by a player, and that is what this replaces.

All **thirteen** of the game's localisations can be narrated.

## What using it looks like

Two minutes of it narrating a real game, screen and voice as they happen:
**[JIMETTS Playing The Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuhVRNcy2Ew)**.

You run one command and it asks the rest. Every question carries the state
behind it, so nothing has to be remembered between sessions.

Pick a campaign with nothing rendered and it says so before you waste a
session, and offers to render it:

how long rendering takes, and offers to do it before you sit down to
play](docs/images/render-windows.png)

Once the game is in front, each screen it reads is one line — the key, whether it
was spoken, and why not when it was not. (The block's own words are printed too;
they are the game's, so they are not reproduced here.)

## Install

You need macOS, Windows, or Linux, **the game installed on the same computer** —
the narrator reads its text files — and about 350 MB free per campaign you
render. No graphics card and nothing fast. Linux capture currently requires an
**X11 session**; Wayland does not permit unattended capture of arbitrary windows.

It needs the internet twice: once to install, and once more the first time you
render in a new language, to fetch that voice. Never during a game.

**macOS**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lunaruser91/journeysInMiddleEarthTextToSpeech/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows**, in PowerShell

![One command, and this is the whole of it: the tools it found, the clone, the
environment, which languages Windows can read the screen in, and a self-test that
tries every part on real data](docs/images/install-windows.png)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lunaruser91/journeysInMiddleEarthTextToSpeech/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Linux (X11)**

Install Python 3.12 or 3.13, Git, FFmpeg, and Tk with your distribution's package
manager. Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lunaruser91/journeysInMiddleEarthTextToSpeech.git ~/jime
python3 -m venv ~/jime-venv
~/jime-venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
~/jime-venv/bin/python -m pip install -e "$HOME/jime[tts,ocr,capture]"
cd ~/jime && ~/jime-venv/bin/python selftest.py
```

Run the game through Steam/Proton from an X11 desktop session. On KDE's login
screen, choose **Plasma (X11)** rather than Plasma (Wayland). Both full-display
and window capture are supported; the narrator recognizes Proton game windows
whose `WM_CLASS` is a Steam application ID.

The macOS and Windows installers install whatever is missing, clone the project,
build the environment, and check the result. Running either one again is also
how you **update**. On Linux, update the clone with `git pull`, then repeat the
two `pip` commands above.

The whole Windows installation, recorded from a clean machine:
**[JIME TTS Install For Windows](https://youtu.be/SGOpxZourBo)**.

One thing it cannot do for you: **macOS needs screen recording permission.**
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording → tick Terminal, then
quit Terminal (`Cmd`+`Q`) and reopen it — the permission is read when a program
starts, so a running terminal keeps the old answer. Without it, capture hangs
rather than failing, which is why this is worth doing before anything else.
Windows and X11 Linux need no screen-recording permission.

Then start it — **macOS**:

```bash
cd ~/jime && ~/jime-venv/bin/python jime.py
```

**Windows**, in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd $HOME\jime; & $HOME\jime-venv\Scripts\python.exe jime.py
```

**Linux**:

```bash
cd ~/jime && ~/jime-venv/bin/python jime.py
```

**The first time, in this order:** extract the corpus, render the audio, then
narrate. Extraction takes a minute, rendering about twenty minutes for a
campaign plus the shared text. After that only narrating matters.

---

## Using it

Run it with no arguments and it asks. Every question shows the state behind it —
which languages have a corpus, how much of each campaign is already rendered —
so you do not have to remember where you left off.

| Option | What it does | When you need it |
|---|---|---|
| **Narrate a game** | Watches the screen and reads each block aloud | Every session |
| **Check this machine** | Whether everything is installed and permitted | When something does not work |
| **Voices** | Lists every voice for this language, and changes it | To change or calibrate a voice |
| **Change language** | Switches the language everything after it uses | Without restarting |

Extracting and rendering are not separate errands. Narrating asks: pick a
language with no corpus and it offers to extract it from your own installation;
pick a campaign with no audio and it offers to render that, and adds `main`
without being asked.

The language is the first question and applies to everything after it — the
corpus, the voice, and the menu itself. `q` quits from anywhere, Enter takes the
highlighted default, and `b` steps back a question.

**Render `main` too.** It holds the text every campaign shares — interface,
tiles, enemy activations, treasure — and about half the blocks spoken in a real
session come from it. A campaign rendered without `main` leaves half the game
silent. The menu offers it when it notices.

---

## During a game

**If the game runs fullscreen, choose the fullscreen option.** Window capture
cannot reach a fullscreen game on macOS or Windows: macOS gives it a Space of
its own and does not draw an inactive Space, and Windows lets exclusive
fullscreen bypass the compositor that screen capture reads from. Where the game
offers *borderless windowed*, that is the better answer on Windows. On Linux,
the X11 backend refreshes the selected window's position and size before every
capture, but fullscreen display capture remains the simplest setup.

The fullscreen option captures the whole monitor, so the narrator waits until
the game is the window in front, and stays quiet whenever it is not. Otherwise
it would read your desktop — in one session it read its own console back.

**The Prologue and Epilogues stay silent on purpose.** The game narrates those
itself, with recorded voice. If your first session opens on a Prologue, nothing
happening is the correct behaviour.

**A few screens are spoken as they appear.** Blocks carrying a value that only
exists at the table — a hero's name, a threat number — cannot be recorded in
advance, so they are synthesised during play from the game's own wording with
the screen's value in the gap.

**If the table reads at its own pace**, `--manual` holds each screen until you
press a key:

```bash
cd ~/jime && ~/jime-venv/bin/python jime.py play --campaign bonesofarnor --display --manual
```

When it is not sure which block is on screen, it says nothing. Silence is
recoverable; narrating the wrong block is not, because the player acts on what
they hear.

---

## When it goes wrong

Choose **Check this machine** from the menu. It names what is missing rather
than failing obscurely.

The most common answers:

- **It finds no game window, or only reads when you alt-tab.** Choose the
  fullscreen option. On Windows, set the game to borderless windowed if it
  offers it.
- **Linux: capture says it requires X11.** Log out, select an X11 session in the
  desktop login screen (for example, **Plasma (X11)**), and log in again. The
  unattended capture used here is not available under Wayland.
- **It recognises screens but says nothing.** That campaign has no audio yet —
  go back and render it. The menu offers this when it notices.
- **It reacts slowly.** Add `--profile` to `jime play`: it times each stage per
  screen, so you can see whether the delay is the game's own animation, the
  OCR, the matcher or the synthesis. On a machine without a graphics card the
  game itself can take the whole processor and leave nothing for the narrator.

  If the slow line is `settling`, some of it is yours to take back. The narrator
  waits for the screen to hold still before reading it — 11 quiet frames, which
  at the default 10 fps is 1.1 s on every screen — because a dialogue box that
  pauses mid-animation looks exactly like one that has finished, and reading it
  early means reading half-drawn text.

  `--profile` also prints `paused Nf`: the longest the game was actually seen to
  pause mid-animation, in frames. `--stable-frames` only has to clear that.
  Measured on one Windows machine over 15 screens, nothing went above 3, and
  `--stable-frames 6` took 0.5 s off every screen with no half-drawn read:

  ```bash
  cd ~/jime && ~/jime-venv/bin/python jime.py play --display --stable-frames 6
  ```

  Check your own `paused` numbers before lowering it — an older recording on
  different hardware found pauses up to 10, which is why the default is 11.
- **Windows: the speech engine will not load.** The Visual C++ Redistributable
  is missing: `winget install --id Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64 -e`
- **Windows: it reads, but eats the accents.** The screen is being recognised in
  the wrong language — most often on an English Windows playing in another
  language. `selftest.py` fails the check `reads the game's own language` and says
  which one it got. In an elevated PowerShell, with your game's language in place
  of `pt-BR`:

  ```powershell
  Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "Language.OCR~~~pt-BR~0.0.1.0"
  ```

  `Get-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "Language.OCR*"` lists all 35. Ukrainian
  is not among them at all — there, `--ocr rapid` is the only option that reads
  the accents.
- **Windows: accented letters come out as `v├í` or `ÔÇö`.** Only when you pipe
  the output somewhere — into `Tee-Object` to keep a log, say. PowerShell decodes
  the pipe with its own code page and no program on the far end can change that,
  so tell your shell once per window:

  ```powershell
  [Console]::OutputEncoding = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8
  cd $HOME\jime; & $HOME\jime-venv\Scripts\python.exe jime.py play --display --profile | Tee-Object output\sessao.log
  ```

  On the screen alone it is already correct; this is only about the pipe.

If capture itself is in doubt, this samples it for you — start it, switch to the
game, come back:

```bash
cd ~/jime && ~/jime-venv/bin/python probe_capture.py --seconds 40
```

It writes to `output/probe.log` rather than the terminal, because looking at the
terminal changes what is being measured.

## Helping measure the OCR

`test_ocr.py` reads back pages it renders itself and reports 0.09% character
error. That is a floor, not the answer: the page is a system serif on flat grey
and the game draws its own font on parchment. The gap between the two can only
be closed by somebody playing.

```bash
cd ~/jime && ~/jime-venv/bin/python jime.py play --display --save-crops crops/
```

Every screen that matched cleanly is kept — one block, won with a margin — so
the corpus text for it is exactly what was on the screen, and:

```bash
cd ~/jime && ~/jime-venv/bin/python test_ocr.py --from-captures crops/
```

scores the recogniser against the game's real pixels. The crops are images of
the game and stay on your machine; the number is the only thing worth sending.
About 1 MB a screen, written after the audio is already queued, so it costs
nothing in speed.

## Sending somebody a log

A normal log carries the game's own text — the block preview under every screen
that matched, and the raw screen text under every one that did not. Add `--share`
and none of it is printed: keys, scores, refusal reasons and timings all stay, and
the text becomes its own shape, "3 paragraph(s), 412 chars". That is enough to
tell a menu screen correctly refused from a real block missed by three points.

```bash
cd ~/jime && ~/jime-venv/bin/python jime.py play --display --profile --share
```

`selftest.py` output is safe to send as it stands — it contains no game text at
all, and paths are written with `~` in place of your home folder:

```bash
cd ~/jime && ~/jime-venv/bin/python selftest.py
```

---

## Updating

Re-run the installer. It pulls and reinstalls and touches nothing else. Or by
hand:

```bash
cd ~/jime && git pull
```

Your corpus, rendered audio and downloaded voices live in `corpus/`, `output/`
and `voices/`, none of which git touches. Updating never re-renders anything —
unless the recipe itself changes, since voice and pace are part of the cache
key. Commits say so when that happens.

---

## Other languages and voices

Every localisation the game ships has a voice, so there is nothing you can read
but not hear.

```bash
cd ~/jime
~/jime-venv/bin/python jime.py voices              # the default voice per language
~/jime-venv/bin/python jime.py languages           # what each localisation supports
~/jime-venv/bin/python jime.py glyphs --lang pt    # which icon words are missing
~/jime-venv/bin/python jime.py clean               # audio left over from an older voice
```

`clean` needs that language **rendered** first — it reads the manifest beside
your audio, never your corpus. `glyphs` is the one that needs an extract.

Portuguese and English have a **measured** reading pace — 155 and 154 words per
minute on the same blocks, which the corpora hold in both languages because
they are translations of each other. The other eleven read at their voice's own
pace, which is whatever its author chose and will not match.

`jime voices --calibrate --lang de` measures one in a few minutes. It needs that
language extracted first, and it prints the line to paste into `voices.py`.

The game's icons are spoken as words in **nine** of the thirteen languages:
Portuguese, English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Korean, Polish and
Russian. Each covers 99% or more of the icons that occur in its own narration.

The four still missing are **Czech, Hungarian, Ukrainian and Chinese**, and
there the icons are dropped rather than guessed — a wrong word is worse than a
silent one, because the player acts on the instruction and cannot tell.

Adding a language is about 21 words, not an investigation. They cannot be
translated from the English: four editions use four different words for the
Might icon, and none of them is Might. They have to be read off the icon
glossary in your own rulebook. `jime glyphs --lang cz --template` prints the
block to fill and paste back, commonest icon first.

---

## Where things live

The installer creates two folders in your home directory: `~/jime` (the project)
and `~/jime-venv` (its Python). **Everything the narrator generates stays inside
`~/jime`** — nothing is scattered elsewhere.

```
corpus/          text extracted from your game        (generated, ignored)
voices/          voice models, ~60 MB each            (ignored)
output/          EVERYTHING that is generated         (ignored)
  audio_<lang>/    the render, plus manifest.json
  live_<lang>/     blocks synthesised during play
  selftest/        what the self-test produced
docs/            how it works, and what it cost to find out
```

---

## How it works

Capture → trigger → OCR → matcher → player. The screen is watched until it
settles, read, matched against the text extracted from your own installation,
and the matching block is spoken. Against 631 real screens rebuilt from the
game's own logs it identifies the right block **99.2%** of the time and speaks
the wrong one 0.5% of the time.

Synthesis is [Piper](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl): a 60 MB ONNX
model on the CPU, no GPU, nothing to sign. It has clear diction and flat
prosody — it reads, it does not act.

The reasoning, the measurements and the mistakes are in
[docs/ENGINEERING.md](docs/ENGINEERING.md), and the individual tools each carry
their own explanation at the top of the file.

The Linux/X11 capture backend was implemented by **OpenAI Codex**.

## License

The code is MIT (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). The game content is not distributed by
this repository and is not covered by it.

`LICENSE` also lists what each dependency declares, because pip installs several
and they are not all MIT — `piper-tts`, which does the speaking, is
GPL-3.0-or-later and is imported directly. That changes nothing about running
this yourself; it is worth reading before redistributing anything built on it.
