"""
capture/base.py — the contract between "get me a frame" and the OS that provides it.

Everything above this line — trigger, OCR, matcher, player — is plain Python and
runs anywhere. Everything below it is platform-specific, and there is no way
around that: grabbing the pixels of another application's window is exactly the
kind of thing operating systems disagree about.

## Why not just take a screenshot

On **macOS 26 Tahoe**, `CGWindowListCreateImage`, `CGDisplayCreateImage` and the
`screencapture` command return only the wallpaper — application windows come back
invisible. That rules out `mss`, `pyautogui` and `PIL.ImageGrab` in one stroke.
ScreenCaptureKit is the only path that still sees windows.

On **Windows**, `BitBlt` and `PrintWindow` return black frames for Unity windows,
because the game renders through the GPU rather than into the window's device
context. Windows.Graphics.Capture is the equivalent answer there.

## Permission, and why running from a terminal matters

macOS attaches screen-recording permission to the *responsible process*. Launched
from a terminal, the grant lands on the terminal application, which is why this
project can stay a set of scripts instead of a signed, notarised `.app`: the
signing requirement exists to distribute a standalone binary, not to capture.

The user grants it once, in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen
Recording, and restarts the terminal. There is no way to request it from inside
Python — the first capture attempt is what makes the prompt appear.
